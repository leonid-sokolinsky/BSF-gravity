# BSF-gravity
Implementation of a parallel algorithm solving a simplified n-body problem

This repository contains source codes of a parallel implementation of an iterative algorithm solving a simplified n-body problem, which describes how a small body will move under the influence of gravita-tional force among large motionless bodies. The solution is built using the BSF-skeleton in C++. The source codes of the BSF-skeleton with a user manual are available at https://github.com/leonid-sokolinsky/BSF-skeleton.

A description of the BSF-gravity algorithm is available in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.03485.
